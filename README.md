## Notes

In the beginning, I kept making small mistakes and errors that would affect the entire program (such as a blank screen with scrollable rows). I had some trouble learning how to implement a fade and understanding a weak cell. Additionally, throughout this entire project I wanted to fully understand the concepts rather than just follow the video. Thus, it was very frustrating at times when I could not grasp a thorough understanding as to how certain features work within the application and connect to one another.
